Backform
========

Backform takes a Backbone model and transforms it into an HTML form with Bootstrap markup.
Any changes to the form are relfected back to the model and vice versa.
It comes with built-in controls for input, select, radio buttons and checkbox.
Backform controls are Backbone views and extensible.
Backform even supports nested objects.
